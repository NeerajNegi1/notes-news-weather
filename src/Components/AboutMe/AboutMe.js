            <p>I am Neeraj Negi I'm currently pursuing BCA from Maharaja Surajmal Institute. I'm a self-taught Digital Marketer, Full Stack Web Developer, And Google Ads Expert. I love to learn new skills and I believe in a learning attitude. I don't want to be a rapper but I do raps and poetry just to reduce my frustration level. I just want to create my own billion dollar empire in the future cause money can buy everything. Wish me luck!</p>
